Assignment
----------

- Deliverable: Markdown file uploaded to GitHub containing the    
  following
- Introduction to the project. The introduction should not start with    
  “For my project I …”. The introduction needs to be written as if you    
  are presenting the work to someone who has given you the data to    
  analyze and wants to understand the result. In other words, pretend    
  it’s not a case study for a course. Pretend it’s a presentation for    
  a client.
- Code for downloading, tidying, and merging data in a R    
  Markdown file.
- Brief explanations of the purpose of the code. The explanations    
  should appear as a sentence or two before or after the code chunk.    
  Even though you will not be hiding the code chunks (so that I can    
  see the code), you need to pretend like the client can’t see them.
- Code to answer the five questions above (plus the answers) in the    
  same R Markdown file.
- Clear answers to the questions, including interpretation of    
  the plots.
- Conclusion to the project. Summarize your findings from    
  this exercise.
- The file must be readable in GitHub – 5 points off if I have to 
  download the file to read it! In other words, don’t forget to keep    
  the md file!!
